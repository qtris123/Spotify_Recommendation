Part1:
URI: Uniform Resource Identifier. We need a URI to perform any function with the API referring to an object in Spotify.

Spotify offers a clientID and a client secret as a username and a password to authenticate with the Spotify web API.

Part2:
- Cluster-based algorithm (lacks the flexibility to add other features to the system)

Part3:
The goal of a recommendation algorithm is to recommend or predict items a user might like based on their data or based 
on the entire user database.

General RS Pipeline:
Data Extraction -> Data Preprocessing -> Find similarity of Items or Users -> Recommendation

Content-based filtering and Collaborative filtering
Content-based filtering:
-  uses features of each item to find the similarities between items.
Collaborative filtering:
- recommends songs based on the overlap of songs in playlists in the dataset.
- User-user CF (focus of this project), item-item CF, model-based CF.

Metadata:
- Genre data -> one-hot encoding
- Popularity data -> normalizing into a range between 0 and 1
- Name + Artist -> use to dedup songs
Audio: (sp.audio_features(track_uri)[0])
- Key -> perform one-hot encoding, because this is a categorical data

Text: 
- track_name -> sentiment analysis -> polarity (0, 1) and subjectivity (-1, 1)
- Polarity: The degree of strong or clearly defined sentiment accounting for negation.
- Subjectivity: The amount of personal opinion and factual information contained in the text.
